Other LAN pcs with ethernet cards, using the Linux server for DNS/DHCP etc.\n\n Basically, I want to route any non LAN traffic through the ppp0. I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modem problems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routing is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be the default route or something).\n Is there standard out of the box Linux tools that will carry out portmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs ?  (I'm planning on non routable addresses 192.168.x.x for the LAN, routed outwards via the ppp0 interface). Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I need to follow? Thanks,Dermot.",
