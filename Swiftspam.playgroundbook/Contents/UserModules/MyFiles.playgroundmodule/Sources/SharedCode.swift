If the CO2 concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth should be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to eventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident as heat.",

The party retrieves the Black Materia, but Sephiroth manipulates Cloud into surrendering it.\nAerith departs alone to stop Sephiroth, following him to an abandoned Cetra city.\nDuring Aerith's prayer to the Planet for help, Sephiroth attempts to force Cloud to kill her; failing, he kills her himself before fleeing and leaving the Black Materia behind.\nThe party then learns that Jenova is not a Cetra as once thought. Rather, it is a hostile alien lifeform whose remains were unearthed by Shinra scientists decades earlier; at Nibelheim, Jenova's cells were used to create Sephiroth.",

I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modem problems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routing is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be the default route or something).\n Is there standard out of the box Linux tools that will carry out portmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs? (I'm planning on non routable addresses 192.168.x.x for the LAN, routed outwards via the ppp0 interface). Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I need to follow? Thanks,Dermot.",
