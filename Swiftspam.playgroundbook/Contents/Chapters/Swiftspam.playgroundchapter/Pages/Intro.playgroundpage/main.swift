 # Suspicious or Familiar ü§î 

 Every crisis brings an opportunity. For developers, it is our skills and effort to create one, for hackers it is their malicious intent. With COVID-19, the world is seeing a revolution in their workplaces where at center of it are our mailbox.
 
 This playground gives you a unique freedom to explore how you can identify one of the most threatening cyber attack that no antivirus can save you from. Yes I am talking about SPAM!
 
 Hi, I am Naman Bishnoi and in this year's WWDC I will discuss about one of the major cyber threats that take down biggest of the big organizations, SPAM! 
 
 SPAM stands for **SusPicious Annoying Mails** (or that's what I think of atleast) and good ones are FAM (**FAmiliar Mails**) which we need to look for. We will explore how you can identify a SPAM email from FAM. First few emails will be selected manually by you just for the sake of training our machine learning model (in this case it's Naive Bayes). After that, it will use that trained model to automatically classify the remaining emails.
 
 Keeping things simple, I have designed this playground to effortlessly segregate emails. To classify the emails, simply:
 - 
 - **Swipe left** for Spam üëª
 - **Swipe right** for Fam üëçüèª
 
 Although, I don't expect a completely spam free mailbox but it gets rid of most unnecessary stuff. This open-source project gives you full right to do whatever you want with your data.
